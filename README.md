# App

This is an app wirtten using react demonstrating a wildly simple shopping experience

# Limitations
* Light on tests. I favour TDD for meaningful applications.
* Not using type checking to its full potential.
* Basic design

# Pre-requisites
* Node v12 +
* yarn 1.*

## Set up
* On your project directory run `npx yarn install` or `yarn install`

## Run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
